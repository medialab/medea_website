The intricacy of such discussions has increasingly augmented in the last twenty years with new actors and new themes entering and transforming the negotiations. On this platform, we will use a graph and three heatmaps to visualize the rise and fall of topics and countries as well as the commitment of the different actors on the different negotiation tables."
