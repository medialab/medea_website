Far from it. Yet readers should be patient for they know that two difficulties complicated our efforts.<br>First, our object – the mapping of emerging debates on adaptation to climate change – is among the thorniest issues of collective life.<br>Second, the digital methods that we employed are still highly experimental.<br>Though sketchy and tentative, we hope that our storylines and maps will still be useful for the actors in the climate change debate and interesting for the general public.
