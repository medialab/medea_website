Situated at the interface of science and policy, the IPCC does not escape this condition. This storyline traces a process of institutional adaptation as the Panel navigates between competing priorities in its assessment making--cultivating legitimacy among its governmental members while maintaining the scientific rigour of its reports.

This same biographical exercise could be conducted for any of the countries in the Mapping IPCC Dynamics database."
