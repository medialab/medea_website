        "A quick list of the principle controversies that have affected the IPCC (some of which are explored in this platform) include: (1) the ongoing and never resolved discussion about including more developing country authors in the assessment process; (2) the opposition by industry groups and oil-producing countries to the Panel's first series of emission scenarios; (3) the controversy related to the phrasing in Chapter 8 of WG1 AR2 about detecting a \"discernable\" influence of humans on \"ongoing climate change\" (critics felt the phrasing was overly confident and \"environmentalist\" in its leaning); (4) the foregrounding of the \"hockey stick\" graph in WG1 of AR3, despite its complicated (and poorly disclosed) use of multiple data sources; (5) and the series of controversies surrounding the run-up to the Copenhagen Conference of Parties, including the \"climategate\" email hacking episode and the series of errors found in WG2 of AR4 which were subsequently labeled in the press as \"Himalayagate\", \"Amazongate\", and Netherlandsgate.\"",
        "For the time being, our data excludes the thousands more individuals who have contributed to reviewing the AR chapters of the IPCC - a very crucial group to the assessment process but for whom we could not find systematic public data. We also do not include an additional set of important work and reports produced by the IPCC-the so called \"Special\" and \"Technical\" Reports, which are much more topic-targeted endeavors. We hope to incorporate these documents into our platform overtime."

      "html": "<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an unprecedented experiment in global environmental knowledge making. Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, the IPCC is overseen by national delegates from its 195 member countries yet fueled by the work of thousands of volunteer scientists. It has proven the primary venue for bringing together a vast array of expertise-from the fields of climate modeling, atmospheric physics, geology, oceanography, ecology, urban studies, medical science, economics, and more-to produce the Panel's flagship Assessment Reports (ARs).</p><p>These reports, broken down into three Working Group (WG) volumes and issued five times over the past 27 years, provide the most comprehensive synthesis of humanity's knowledge of the causes, consequences and possible responses to our changing climate. Barring slight modifications in the early reports, the structure of the WGs has remained remarkably consistent: WGI addresses the physical basis for climate change; WGII focuses on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change; and WGIII analyses possible policy responses and mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The First Assessment Report (AR1) took two years to write, involved 700 experts and spanned nearly 1000 pages. The most recent AR5 took 7 years to complete, involved nearly 1,800 experts and spans over 5000 pages of scientific assessment and technical appendices.</p><p>With each report, the findings point even more irrevocably to the disturbing influence human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, is having on the stability of the global climate system. These conclusions, although subject to one of the most complex and rigorous peer-review processes in the history of science, have also placed the group at the heart of the so-called \"climate wars\" (Poole, 2010). This notoriety has forced the Panel to confront heated attacks to its credibility, accusations of political-bias, occasional errors in its reporting, and even opposition by its own government delegates and scientific contributors. <a href=\"#\" class=\"exponent\" popover-trigger=\"focus\" popover-append-to-body=\"true\" popover-placement=\"right\" popover=\"{{section.notes[0]}}\" noteIndex=\"1\">*</a></p><p>In order to fend off these different slings and arrows, the Panel has had to balance the autonomy and scientific integrity of its assessment-making with its legitimacy and political salience as an organization-the \"classic twin goals of a science-policy boundary organization\" (Hulme and Mahoney, 2010; Guston, 2001). Over the years, this has translated into an increasing formalization of the principles governing the Panel's assessment procedures. Following each set of controversies, the leaders of the IPCC have responded with a new round of rules addressing everything from how the Panel selects its authors, to its process for incorporating dissenting scientific voices into its reports, to its coordination of assessment-making between its different expert groups.</p><p>Our goal with this interactive visual platform is to construct a dynamic portrait of the structure and internal relations of the organization - and map this portrait to the shifting relationship between the formal rules and informal practices of assessment making within the IPCC. By paying attention to the movement, repetition and sub-organizational affiliations of IPCC participants overtime, we become aware of a rich field of micro-level and meso-level phenomenon that have avoided attention in most interpretative approaches to the organization.<a href=\"#\" class=\"exponent\" popover-trigger=\"focus\" popover-append-to-body=\"true\" popover-placement=\"right\" popover=\"{{section.notes[1]}}\" noteIndex=\"2\">*</a></p>"

      "html": "<p>In order to begin looking at these dynamics, we first have to get our hands around the authors of the IPCC. There have been roughly 4,300 individuals that have participated as authors to the IPCC. These authors come from 117 countries and are affiliated with over 1,200 institutions. These individuals, and their information, are found within the chapters and appendices of the IPCC Assessment Reports (as seen at right). </p><p>Our empirical data involves information on these contributors including their names, country of affiliation, institution of affiliation, role in the IPCC (one of four possible roles), their chapter participation (they can participate in more than one chapter per AR), their Working Group (WG) affiliation (they can participate in more than one WG per AR) and their AR participation (they can also participate in more than one AR). </p><p>We scrapped this information from the ARs (either from pdfs or from html versions of later reports), and structured the data into a relational database, linking each attribute of information to other attributes via a series of interlinked tables. We also added additional information to our data tables, such as economic or political groupings of different countries in the IPCC, a classification of institution types<a href=\"#\" class=\"exponent\" popover-trigger=\"focus\" popover-append-to-body=\"true\" popover-placement=\"right\" popover=\"{{section.notes[0]}}\" noteIndex=\"1\">*</a> and World Bank data per country on per capita income, population, amount of scientific publications per year and number of CO2 emissions per year. This gave us the means to create queries based on specific questions that we wanted to ask our data, for instance, \"How many authors from Least Developed Countries (LDC) participated as Lead Authors in the WGI and in which chapters? How does this compare to their participations in WGII and WGIII? What can we tell about the expertise of LDCs by their participation in specific chapters?\"</p>"

      "html": "<p>Before we could even come close to making queries of our database, we were confronted by the heterogenity of how the IPCC documented information regarding its authors AR to AR. Over 25 years of organizational life the status of authorship itself underwent slight modifications.</p><p>Roles, for instance, are not comparable across all ARs. It was not until 1999 that the Bureau of the IPCC voted to create four standardized roles for each chapter of the three WGs-Coordinating Lead Author (CLA), Lead Author (LA), Review Editor (RE) and Contributing Author (CA)-each with a clear responsibility. Prior to AR3, there was neither a standardized way that the WGs structured the writing of chapters nor a standardized way for assigning roles to contributors. Everything was very informal, decided often within the chapters themselves. This is reflected in the diagrams at right, where in the first ARs, we can see that role designations within the same WGs could change drastically. </p><p>In building our dataset, we took the idiosyncratic roles designated in the chapters of the early in the ARs and retroactively applied the four codified roles of the AR3, AR4 and AR5 to these idiosyncratic roles (see the color coding for AR2 and AR3). Since the role of Review Editor does not appear in the database prior to AR3, no one is assigned this role in preceding ARs, although the function existed informally among chapter authors. </p><p>There was an additional set of data decisions needed around names of authors, countries and institutions, which often differed chapter by chapter due to the use of initials versus full names for authors, or anglicized versus original language names for non-anglophone institutions. We tried as much as possible to keep the non-anglophone versions of the institutions. </p><p>Additional challenges drove yet more choices. For instance, individual contributors may change institutions and thus it is possible within the database to have more than one institutional affiliation. Within the same AR, sometimes contributors indicate two institutional affiliations. In these cases we always took the first institution as the primary affiliation. With country affiliations it is slightly trickier, also a reflection of the changing pressures on the organization-initially the country attached to a contributor was the country of the contributor's institutional affiliation. Beginning in the AR4, contributors began also noting their country of origin or citizenship, along with the country affiliation of their institutional home (who, for developed countries, was often supporting their participation in the IPCC). This introduced a challenge of identifying contributors as coming from two countries. We made the decision to always take the first country listed of affiliation, and clarify that this is not necessarily the country of the contributor's citizenship, but simply their primary country of affiliation. </p><p>This question is at the heart of one of the long simmering tensions within the organization, which involves pressure by developing countries to increase the geographic diversity of contributors in the IPCC to better represent developing countries, and issue we treat in one of our storylines.</p><p> </p>"

        "While the treemap as a visualization gives a good first exposure to our data, it also imposes notions of hierarchy that do not necessarily reflect the way the organization functions, and does not capture the diversity and tensions of knowledge and culture that exist between the authors."
      ],
      "html": "<p>Once we completed the process of cleaning and harmonizing our various categories of data, we began testing different visual layout designs that targeted different aggregations of attributes, switching from the contributor or the participation as the primary unit of analysis to looking at the IPCC from the perspective of the country, working group, or specific role in the organization. The treemap shown at right, for instance, renders what would otherwise be a massive amount of information graspable and navigable starting at the level of geographic regions. It provides a good first plunge into the breadth of individuals and institutions involved in the IPCC.<a href=\"#\" class=\"exponent\" popover-trigger=\"focus\" popover-append-to-body=\"true\" popover-placement=\"right\" popover=\"{{section.notes[0]}}\" noteIndex=\"1\">*</a> </p><p>Our qualitative knowledge of the organization guided these explorations, particularly our work at identifying moments of reorganization with the IPCC due to controversies and criticisms, both internal and external. Combined with interviews of IPCC authors as well as close readings of official IPCC documents and meeting notes, primary written accounts, secondary scholarly articles and a good deal of press, we situate an initial set of cultural arguments (along with accompanying static and interactive visualizations) about the IPCC's ability to adapt overtime to various pressures to its legitimacy and credibility. Our initial analysis suggests that informal institutional responses and spillover effects to rule-making may play a larger role in the success of assessment making than is currently acknowledged and may have important implications for future organizational design.</p><p>Accompanied by specifically designed visual forms, these stories include: 1) an analysis of how different goals within the organization-producing robust scientific assessments vs. including as many developing country authors as possible-have created informal institutional responses that function to balance the challenges of maintaining scientific integrity vs. organizational legitimacy; 2) a look at how structural conditions of the organization have lead to poor coordination between the IPCC's three Working Groups-and how poor coordination has been at the root of the controversy that most threatened the credibility of the Panel; and 3) a case study exploring how the IPCC operates as a global \"social infrastructure\" (Edwards, 2010) in the realm of climate expertise, creating a feedbacks between national expertise and international knowledge-making. We trace the \"biography\" of French experts in the IPCC to develop this last storyline. </p><p>An added goal of this work is that the visual layouts (particularly the interactive layouts) and their available underlying data will also leave room for others to suggest alternative interpretations of organizational dynamics. Finally, I want to emphasize finally that our stories are but initial attempts at writing and arguing in tandem with (sometimes) interactive quantitative data. While we were able to conduct a small number of interviews, and counted among our project partners climatologists and IPCC authors from the Laboratoire des Science de Changement de l'Environnement in France, there remains much more qualitative research to do to verify some of the quantitative hunches we followed regarding organizational dynamics. </p><h5></h5><p><strong>References</strong></p><ul><li>Edwards, P. 2010.
