        "html": "<p>Multidisciplinarity is a difficult enterprise. It demands that you leave the comfortable niches of academic research and venture into largely unexplored territory, where conceptual notions and methodological techniques need to be constantly re-discussed and re-defined.</p><p>In itself, multidisciplinarity does not necessarily have a value. Disciplinary frontiers have not be established by mistake, they have been built in order to allow researchers to focus on their specific objects and methods and to advance in their investigations without having to deal all the time with the unreduced complexity of natural and social dynamics.</p><p>In some case, however, multidisciplinarity is indispensable. When dealing with emerging problems, fluctuating issues, debates that span multiple sectors and unsettle numerous equilibriums, the frontiers of traditional disciplines becomes constraints that hinder understanding and action.</p><p>Climate adaptation is a problem of such a type and that is why we proposed a multidisciplinary project to deal with it.</p><p>Funded by the Agence National de Recherche (ANR), MEDEA is a multidisciplinary project based bringing together:</p><ul><li>social sciences (the Sciences Po me&#x301;dialab),</li><li>climate sciences (the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et l&apos;Environnement)</li><li>information design (Ecole Nationale Supe&#x301;rieure des Arts De&#x301;coratifs)</li></ul><p> </p><p>This effort of multidisciplinarity has had its cost (and a large extent of the resources of the project has been consumed by the work of coordination and translation) but it has also provided a significant added value. Such value is in part returned through the results presented in this project, but in part it is also accumulated in the connections that this project has created and that, hopefully, will pave the way for other projects and research endeavors that combine our different approaches to the world.. </p>"

        "html": "<p>Until the early 2000s adaptation was largely disregarded in the debate on climate change as it was seen as a diversion from the ultimate objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, because of multiple factors (including growing doubts about the efficacy of mitigation engagements and increasing evidence on the unavoidability of impacts presented in the 2001 IPCC's AR3) adaptation has since risen to the top of the international policy, research and expertise agendas. This \"adaptation turn\" is visible in UNFCCC negotiations, IPCC expertise, and national climate strategies.</p><p>At the international level of negotiations, adaptation become one of the four \"pillars\" of the Bali Action Plan at the 2007 Conference of the Parties (COP) in Indonesia. In the realm of expertise, the IPCC AR4 (2007) and, the more recent AR5 (2014) have placed renewed attention on adaptation. And an increasing range of other actors, from the US Military to environmental NGOs are highlighting the need to prepare for the disruptive consequences of climate change.</p><p>In sum, adaptation is now being integrated at all levels of climate politics - not just in international negotiations and expertise but also at the individual country level, from national to sub-national to municipal jurisdictions, in both developing and developed countries.</p><p>Though irreversible, the rise of adaptation is not uncontroversial. Preparing for climate impacts demands transformations across nearly all societal sectors and to do so in a context laden with uncertainty. Should we adapt to the impacts of anthropogenic climate change projected by the global and regional circulation models? Or should we adapt keeping the worst case scenario, the so called \"tipping points\", in mind? How to distinguish climate vulnerabilities from the socio-economic factors that precede them? Is not the question of adaptation intrinsically tied to the problem of development in poor and emerging countries, and to questions of infrastructure, land use and urban planning in more developed countries?</p><p>Current debates on adaptation reflect this transversal and multifaceted character of adaptation. They intertwine scientific uncertainties about the downscaling of climate models, diplomatic equilibriums, political struggles and financial dynamics. The MEDEA project cannot aspire to solve such &#x2018;super-wicked' problems, but hope to contribute to their deciphering. Unraveling the imbroglios of adaptation demands more patience than resolution and it is this patience that we tried to provide in this project by bringing together researchers from different disciplines and by exploiting the potential of digital data, computation and visualization.</p><p> </p><p>The results presented in this website are two series of &#x2018;narratives', each weaving together a set of advanced data visualizations and using them to map the dynamics of scientific and political discussions about climate adaptation, respectively in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and in the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>"

        "html": "<p><p>The atlas proposed in this website is the result of a 3 year collaborative project funded by the ANR (programmes Changements Environnementaux Planétaires et Sociétés) and 20 years of experience of controversy mapping.</p><p>Derived from the description of the technoscientific quarrels developed by the Science and Technology Studies, controversy mapping was introduced by Bruno Latour as a teaching method to train students and future citizens to navigate socio-technical debates through the creative use of digital media. The research aim of controversy mapping is to open up the black-boxes of science and technology and expose the complexity of their construction. Not to debunk them, but to show the amazing amount of work required to build them and to associate more and more actors to such work. The political aim of controversy mapping is to provide innovative methods for approaching scientific and technical disputes. Instead of worrying about the fact that the public is exposed to disagreement, controversy mapping asks what advantages can be drawn by rendering controversies more \"readable\". Instead of worrying about how science might be contaminated by political interference and lamenting the fragmentation of society, controversy mapping asks under what conditions can public intervention enhance scientific discussion and what tools can be harnessed to help citizens navigate controversies. The metaphor of mapping is itself controversial. Though few of their pages resemble to standard geographical maps, controversy atlases have the same objective of classic travel atlases and they struggle with the same difficulties. They aim at providing as much detail as possible on a region while remaining compact and legible; at respecting the unique characteristics that define a territory, while translating them in a standard visual language. Only, the objects that these atlases are not (in most cases) geographical territories, but rather issues or a matters of concern. In this sense, the words &#x2018;atlas' and &#x2018;map' should be taken somewhat metaphorically (in the same way as one can talk about botanical or medical atlas). Not so much because our territories are discursive more than geographical, but because the quality and the standardization of our maps is still far from that of proper atlases.</p><p>Related research projects:</p><ul><li>MACOSPOL (mapping controversies on science for politics) 2007-09, EU FP7 Sciences in Society</li><li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fclimaps.eu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGMRimCtdaD61e-qK10tizeHvUbsw\">EMAPS</a> (electronic maps to assist public science) 2011-14, EU FP7 Sciences in Society</li><li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforccast.hypotheses.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHpopzlxXl4sd0FdCXMxpbgqMfPSw\">FORCCAST</a> (formation &#xE0; la C.C. pour l'analyse de sciences et des techniques) 2012-20, IDEFI Investissements de l'Avenir</li></ul></p>\n"

    "subtitle": "Earth's climate is changing. Slowly but inexorably. As determined by the latest IPCC Assessment Report (2014), the actions so far to reduce greenhouse emissions are insufficient and the first impacts of global warming are beginning to show. Like it or not, our collective life will have to adapt to its changing environment and the trade-offs will not be easy or painless. This awareness is prompting the emergence of debates around the world about how best to adapt to a changing climate."
